/*
* Objects of the class Line represent lines defined by two two-dimensional 
* points. The points are stored as pointers to objects of class Point.
* One important issue about Line is that it does not own the Point 
* objects to which it stores pointers. This means that the only way to 
* provide the points defining a line is by someone else allocating these
* points and giving them to the Line ready made. As the constructors and 
* other methods of Line do not allocate the memory for the Point objects,
* the methods of the class are not in charge of deallocating this memory.
* It would be an error to deallocate this memory even by the destructor.
* Similarly, the copy constructor of Line should not create new Point 
* objects, but instead perfom a shallow copy of the Point pointers.
* Your job is to complete the implementation by adding private variables
* and complete all the function members of the class given below.
