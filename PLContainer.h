/*
* PLContainer is a container for storing and managing points and lines.
* More precisely, it stores two arrays, one of pointers to objects of
* class Point, and one of pointers to objects of class Line.
* It manages (allocates and frees) the memory for all the Point and Line
* objects and the arrays storing the pointers. 
* When adding points and lines, reserving additional space for the 
* corresponding array may be necessary. For this, the private member
* functions resizePointsArray_ and resizeLinesArray_ should be implemented.
* When an object of class PLContainer is destroyed, all the memory allocated 
* for it should be deallocated.
* Your job is to complete the implementation by adding private variables
* and complete all the function members of the class given below.
