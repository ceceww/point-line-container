# point-line-container
A class for a container for storing and managing geometric points and lines. Class for representing two dimensional points with coordinates of type double, and another class for representing lines defined by two points, i.e. lines given in two-point form.  

The file main.cpp contains illustration of some basic usage. The makefile will attempt to build the main file, as well as files PointMain, LineMain and PLContainerMain which can be used to test the program.  

The way to run the tests is:   

./PointMain e d c b a   

or just   

./PointMain a   
./PointMain b   
Similarly for LineMain and PLCMain.
